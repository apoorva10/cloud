Additional Notes:

1)We have 10 threads which will run to accept input from the user and compute the value of pi
2)10 threads always run but not the instances.
3)We have used gnome to display the 10 threads running so that it will be easy to visualize.
4)As soon as you run the start.py,there will be 10 terminals displayed on your system(BUT INSTANCES ARE NOT YET STARTED)
5)Used rabbit mq for queueing the inputs and not SQS.
6)As soon as the insatnce is created and before ssh into the instance we have given a delay of 60 second so that even if the net is slow,it won't run into problems and hence the output got is DELAYED BY A MINUTE.(SLOW OUTPUT BECAUSE OF SLEEP AND NOT THE LOGIC).
7)App tier instances are created only on demand(Initially only a web tier instance is created and an S3 Bucket).
